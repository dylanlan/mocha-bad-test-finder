Mocha Bad Test Finder
==================

Do you have some annoying tests?

Want to improve your tests so they're easier to maintain?

If so, this package might be for you!

This package can help you find bad tests that could be improved

Some examples of bad tests:
* Tests that are too large (eg: 50 lines+, which are hard to understand & maintain)
* Tests that are flaky (eg: tests that fail 1% of the times they're run)
* Tests that interact with each other (eg: running a test by itself fails, but succeeds when run all together)

This package is still under development

TODO:
* Add CLI commands & help
* Add large and flaky test usage
* Add tests
